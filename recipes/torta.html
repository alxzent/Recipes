    <p>
        For the longest time, my favorite food was tortas, specifically torta cubanas. 
        Their compact nature inticed me, as I was and still am a huge meat lover. This
        torta comes with all the perks of other tortas, the most supreme of all tortas.
        It's packed with eggs, ham, cheese, milanesa, sausage, beans, chorizo, veggies, and 
        some avocado. Young Alex could not get enough of this angelical concoction. Today,
        I get to share that experience with you.
